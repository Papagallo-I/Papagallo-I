- 👋 Hi, I’m @Papagallo-I
- 👀 I’m interested in data and the graphics to represent analysis outputs. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code (Python 3, of course), and all I can about AI and ML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an App that uses data, graphics and AI to anylize for SOLUTIONS across several pain spaces.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I'm not sure. But I'll get back on this.
